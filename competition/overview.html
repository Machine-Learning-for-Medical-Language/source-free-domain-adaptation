<h1 style="color:grey"> Overview</h1>
<p>Data sharing restrictions are common in NLP datasets, particularly in the clinical domain.
   Here, we propose a new shared task framework that asks participants to develop semantic annotation systems in face of data sharing constraints.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20; color: black">1. Goal of this SemEval Task:</p>
<p>To develop a system for a target domain when annotations exist for a related domain but cannot be distributed:
<li>Participants will be given a model trained on the annotations of one domain.</li>
<li>Then, participants will be asked to make predictions of unlabeled target domain data</li>

We propose two different semantic tasks to which this framework will be applied: negation detection and time expression recognition.

<p style="font-size: 18; color: blue">2.1 Negation Detection</p>
<p><b>EXAMPLE</b>: The sentence <i>'Has no diarrhea and no new lumps or masses'</i> has two negation words (both <i>no</i>) and all three entities <i>(diarrhea, lumps, masses)</i> are negated. Participants were expected to treat it as "span-in-context" classification problem. The following example is a typical transformer-based encoding of this problem for the <i>diarrhea</i> event and the corresponding label is negated.</p>
<p style="background-color:Linen"> INPUT SENTENCE: Has no &lte&gt diarrhea &lt/e&gt and no new lumps or masses</p>
<p><b>DATASET:</b>
<li>1. Pre-trained model:  Participants will be provided with a "span-in-context" classification models (XXX) trained on the 10259 instances (902 negated) clinical notes from Mayo Clinic.</li>
<li>2. Development Data for Practice Phase: i2b2 2010 Challenge Dataset containing 7038 entites. We simplify the classification label space to {negated, notnegated}.</li>
<li>3. Test Data for Evaluation Phase: Participants will be provided with raw text drawn from MIMIC corpus with entities of interest identified and asked to predict negation status of each entity</li>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18; color: blue">2.2 Time Expressions</p>

<li>1. Pre-trained model:  Participants will be provided with a sequence tagging model (character-based FLAIR) trained on the 25,000+ time expressions in clinical portion of the SemEval 2018 Task 6.</li>
<li>2. Development Data for Practice Phase: the annotated news portion of the SemEval 2018 Task 6.</li>
