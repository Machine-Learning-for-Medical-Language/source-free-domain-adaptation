<p><strong>Negation detection</strong> will be evaluated using the standard precision, recall and F<sub>1</sub> scores as used in most published work: recall points are gained by correctly predicting that a negated entity is negated, precision points are obtained if a predicted negation is correct.</p>
<p><strong>Time expression recognition</strong> will be evaluated using the standard precision, recall and F<sub>1</sub> previously used for the entity-finding portion of SemEval 2018 Task 6.</p>
